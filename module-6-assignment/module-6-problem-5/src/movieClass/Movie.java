package movieClass;

/*
 * Consider a class Movie that contains information about a movie. 
 * The class has the following attributes:

The movie name
The MPAA rating (e.g. G, PG, PG-13, R)
The number of people that have rated this movie as a 1 (Terrible)
The number of people that have rated this movie as a 2 (Bad)
The number of people that have rated this movie as a 3 (OK)
The number of people that have rated this movie as a 4 (Good)
The number of people that have rated this movie as a 5 (Great)

Implement the class with accessors and mutators for the movie name and MPAA rating.
 Write a method addRating that takes an integer as an input parameter. 
 The method should verify that the parameter is a number between 1 and 5, and if so, 
 increment by one the number of people rating the movie that matches the input parameter. 
 For example, if 3 is the input parameter, then the number of people that rated the movie as a 3 should be incremented by one. 
 Write another method, getAverage, that returns the average value for all the movie ratings.

Test the class by writing a main method that creates at least two movie objects, adds at least five ratings for each movie, and output the movie name, MPAA rating, and average rating for each movie object.
